Netview - a software component to visualize packet tracks, hop-by-hop delays,
          sampling stats and resource consumption. Netview requires the deployment of
          distributed probes (impd4e) and a central packet matcher to correlate the
          obervations.

          The probe can be obtained at http://impd4e.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
